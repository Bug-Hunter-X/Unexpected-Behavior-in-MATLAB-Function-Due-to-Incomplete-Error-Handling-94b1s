# MATLAB Function with Incomplete Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB: incomplete error handling in functions. The `myFunction.m` file contains a function with a conditional statement to manage negative inputs. However, it lacks comprehensive error handling for other potential issues that may arise during execution, such as invalid input types or division by zero. 

The `myFunctionSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the function that includes more robust error handling. This improved version checks for various issues and reports appropriate errors using `error` statements and provides alternative behavior using `try-catch` blocks.

## How to Reproduce the Bug
1. Run the `myFunction.m` script with both positive and negative input values.
2. Observe that while the negative input is handled correctly, the handling of other potential input values (such as non-numeric inputs) will not behave as expected or could crash.

## How to Fix the Bug
1. Review the `myFunctionSolution.m` file for a better implementation of the function.
2. Note how the solution incorporates detailed error handling to check for and address various potential problems.
3. Implement comprehensive error handling in your own MATLAB functions to prevent unexpected behavior and crashes.
